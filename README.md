Description of the game and why I chose it for my project:
- Mastermind is a code-breaking game. The goal is for the player to guess a generated code of colored pegs. The player has eight attempts to do so. After each guess, feedback is provided:
A black peg will indicate the player guessed correct color in the correct position, while a pink
peg will indicate the player guessed the correct color but in the wrong position.

- I chose Mastermind as my game project because I like the logical challenge of the game. Addiotionally, I was also interested in developing a single-player game, as our class primarily focused on multiplayer games like tic-tac-toe.

Future enhancements: 
Future enhancements for this Mastermind project include:
- Styling omprovements: Enhancing the overall design of the game to add a personal touch with custom colors, as the current color scheme is generic.
- Player feedback: Improving the visibility of player attempts by adding level indicators (1-8) in the middle of the grid.
