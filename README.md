Your gameâ€™s name: Include a description of your game and what it does. Background info about the game and why you chose it is a nice touch.
- Mastermind is a code-breaking game. The goal is for the player to guess a generated code of colored pegs. The player has eight attempts to do so. After each guess, feedback is given. A black peg will indicate the player guessed correct color in correct position. While a feedback peg of white will indicate the player guessed the correct color but in the wrong position.

- I chose Mastermind as my game project because I like the logic of the game. I was also interested in building a single player game, since we've covered multiplayer game in class like tic-tac-toe.
